# Get the News
You're going to build an app that, upon launching, sends an axios request to [the news API](https://newsapi.org/) and renders a list of those stories.

## Getting started
- `Fork` and `clone` this repository and `cd` into it.
- Run `npm i` to ensure your copy has all the necessary dependencies
- Run `npm install axios` to ensure you have Axios in your project
- Visit [the news API](https://newsapi.org/) and sign up to get an API key. The endpoint that you'll be hitting is `https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=${YOUR NEWS SOURCE}&apiKey=${YOUR API KEY}`.
